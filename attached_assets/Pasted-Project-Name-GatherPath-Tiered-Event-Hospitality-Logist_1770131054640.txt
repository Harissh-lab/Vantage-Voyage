Project Name: GatherPath - Tiered Event Hospitality & Logistics Platform

Objective: Build a full-stack platform for travel agents to manage bulk event bookings (weddings/corporate). The app uses a "Label-based" permission system to manage Guest experiences, travel logistics, and expense coverage.

1. Tech Stack:

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (Luxury/Professional Aesthetic).

Backend: Node.js.

Database: PostgreSQL (Tables: Users, Events, Labels, Guests, Requests).

2. The 3-Page Guest Flow:

Page 1: RSVP & Identity: A "Find Your Invitation" search. Identifies the Guest and their assigned "Label" (e.g., VIP, Friend).

Page 2: Travel & Rooming:

Fixed Travel: Show read-only Travel Dates (Up/Down) and Mode (Flight/Train) as pre-arranged by the Agent/Client. Guests cannot change these dates.

Rooming: Family head sees their name. "+ Add Family Member" button to add dependents. Logic: Suggest number of rooms based on total count.

Page 3: Add-on Concierge (Crucial Logic):

The Client dashboard must have two toggles for every Add-on (Pickup, Meals, etc.):

"Allow Service" (Yes/No).

"Expense Handled by Client" (Yes/No).

IF Expense Handled = YES: Guest sees the perk as "Included" and clicks "Confirm."

IF Expense Handled = NO: Guest sees the perk but with a "Contact Agent to Book/Pay" button.

This button should allow the Guest to Call or Message the Agent directly to arrange private payment. This button is only visible if "Expense Handled" is unticked.

3. User Role Dashboards:

Agent View:

Input fixed event dates/travel modes.

Manage a "Request Inbox" for guests asking for permissions.

Direct contact link for guests who need to pay out-of-pocket.

Client View (The Host):

Create "Labels" (VIP, Staff, etc.).

For each label, use checkboxes to:

Enable/Disable specific perks.

Mark whether the Client is paying for that perk or if the Guest pays the Agent.

Guest View: Personalized based on the settings above.

4. Design Requirements:

Use a "Lovable" professional theme (Champagne/Navy/Slate).

Ensure the "Contact Agent" button on Page 3 is prominent for self-paying guests.

Mobile-responsive (essential for guests traveling).

5. Data Logic:

If a guest requests a perk not allowed for their label, create a "Request" record.

The Agent can "Forward to Client" for final approval of costs.
